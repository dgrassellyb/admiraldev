# Introduction

This article explains how we do package releases for `{admiral}` and across all our
package extensions. This includes details around planned/scheduled releases, as well
as hotfixes.

# Release Schedule

A release schedule is maintained on the [homepage](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/#release-schedule).

# Planning Releases

Whenever we start looking towards a future release, we create a new release issue
label on GitHub of the form `release Q4-2022` for example. This then can be added
to all the issues we plan to cover in the release and these can be moved to the
Priority column of our project board.

We should share in advance with our users a high level summary of expected package
updates via the community meetings, especially any anticipated breaking changes.

# Package Release Process

## Quarterly Release

A package release is done in five parts:

1) Create a Pull Request from `devel` into the `pre-release` branch.  Issues identified in this Pull Request should have work done in separate branches and merged into the `pre-release` branch and **NOT** `devel`.
1) Verify that all CI/CD checks are passing for the `devel` into the `pre-release` Pull Request, merge and then bundle up and send off to CRAN.
1) Once the package is available on CRAN, another Pull Request is created for merging the `pre-release` branch into the `main` branch.  This will trigger the GitHub action to rebuild the `{admiral}` website with all the updates for this release.
1) Use the release button on GitHub to "release" the package onto GitHub.  This release onto Github archives the version of code within the `main` branch, attaches the News/Changelog file, bundles the code into a `tar.gz` file and makes a validation report via the GitHub action `validation` from [insightsengineering/validatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR).  Please see past [admiral releases](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) for reference. 
1) Any issues fixed in the `pre-release/main` branches should be merged back into `devel`.  

**Quarterly Release:**  `devel >> pre-release >> main` 

## Hot Fix Release

Occasionally we will need to release a hot fix to address a package breaking bug.  A hot fix release is done in 6 parts:

1) Identify all the bugs that need to be fixed for this hot fix release and label with hot fix label.
1) Branches addressing the bugs should have Pull Requests merged into the `patch` branch **NOT** the `devel` branch.
1) When naming the branch follow the [naming conventions](git_usage.html#implementing-an-issue) guide but use the `@main` suffix 
1) Create a Pull Request from `patch` into the `pre-release` branch.  Verify that all CI/CD checks are passing, merge and bundle up and send off to CRAN.
1) Once package is approved and available on CRAN, another Pull Request is created for merging the `pre-release` branch into the `main` branch.  This will trigger the action to rebuild the `{admiral}` website with all the updates for this hot fix release.
1) Use the release button on GitHub to "release" the package onto GitHub.  This release onto Github archives the version of code within the `main` branch, attaches the News/Changelog file, bundles the code into a `tar.gz` file and makes a validation report via the GitHub action `validation` from [insightsengineering/validatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR).  Please see past [admiral releases](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) for reference.
1) These hot fixes should then be merged into the `devel` branch through an additional Pull Request.  

**Hot Fix Release**: `patch >> pre-release >> main  >> devel`

# Communications

After the release, we raise awareness via our Slack channel and LinkedIn.
